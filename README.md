Module-1 Challenge

Code Refactor

This is the end of module 1 challege for coding bootcamp.  In this challege I was tasked with taking existing code and refactoring it to meet semantic HTML and accessibility guidelines.  My goals when tackling this refactor was to remove as much of the extraneous or repetitive code as I could while consolidating as many elements as possible.  Additionally, I wanted to make the HTML look nice.


## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

While working on this project I encountered several instances where parent and child containers were not clearly understood.  I was able by the end to see that the HTML elements, when arranged properly, could follow not only coding logic, but could make sense to me just by looking at them.

The CSS was a bit more challenging in that attention to detail was required.  When images would not behave like I expected them to it was usually due to an error in CSS syntax, or a stray period (.) that I overlooked.
